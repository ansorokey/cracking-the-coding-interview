"""
It can be very easy to mix up exponents and bases.
The depth (number of layers) of a tree is always O(branches^depth)
In this example, the fibonacci causes us to branch twice. So there are two branches.
That gives us O(2^n)
If this function branched into three diferent calls, it owuld have been O(3^n)
