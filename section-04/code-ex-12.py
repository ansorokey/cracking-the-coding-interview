Which of the following are equivilent to O(n) and why?

A. O(n + p) where p < n/2
B. O(2n)
C. O(n + log n)
D. O(n + m)
"""


"""
Initial thoughts:
A is NOT because regardless of size, it is dependant on two unique inputs.

B IS because 2n cn reduce to just n.

C IS because wen it's additive, we just take the slower option.

D is NOT because this also runs on two unique inputs.
