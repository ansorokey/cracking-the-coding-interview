# cracking-the-coding-interview
A collection of my notes and coding practices as I go through this book and do my very best at Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition!
(I said the [title](https://youtu.be/zigTx34rpsw?si=mmhMgzbUTvU0UMqO))

Please excuse the typos you are bound to see.
I am typing this on a chromebook between breaks and downtime as work. And this chromebook doesnt have a delete, home, or end button, so I'm smashing keys I didn't mean to press from muscle memory. Edgar Allen Woe is me.
Other than that, have fun!

(If you DO spot a typo, an error, or a hobbile explanation, feel free to raise a github issue and let me know about it!)

Questions:
*Shouldn't you present these notes in a more professional manner for the world - and potential recruiters - to see?*
Maybe, but I won't. My notes, MY RULES. If you're going to read my hard work, you're going to sit through whatever puns I feel like putting you through. Thus I have spoken.

*Can you upload a pdf of the book for me to download?*
Y'argh, no matey.

*Are you running out of hypothetical strawman questions you made up to pad out this readme?*
Yes. Next question.

*You uh...you catch the game last night?*
No further questions, your honor.
