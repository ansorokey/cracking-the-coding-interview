The book solution works similarly to what I came up with, but uses an array to 
store booleans instead. Not very familiar with Java, so I'm not sure how it is
converting a character into an index. It could possibly be the ascii value, but
I don't see any conversions.

Other than that, I think we got the gist of it.
